## Brief Description of the Research Problem

Ceylon pepper cultivation in Sri Lanka is significantly affected by plant diseases, improper fertilizer usage, and lack of crop variety optimization. Farmers often rely on traditional visual inspections, which are prone to human error and delay timely interventions. Additionally, limited access to real-time market insights and scientific agricultural support further restricts productivity and profitability. These issues result in reduced crop yield, increased plant mortality, and economic instability for pepper farmers.

## Brief Description of the Research Solution

This research introduces an integrated smart agriculture solution powered by image processing, geospatial analytics, and machine learning to modernize Ceylon pepper farming. The solution is composed of the following key components:

- **Image-Based Diagnosis System**  
  Analyzes images of pepper leaves to identify common diseases such as yellow mottle, lace bug infection, and vine borer infection. The system delivers real-time detection and treatment suggestions via a user-friendly interface.

- **Machine Learning-Based Model for Predicting Black Pepper Prices**  
  Uses historical market data to forecast future black pepper prices in Sri Lanka, helping farmers make informed selling decisions.

- **Location-Based Ceylon Pepper Variety Recommendation System**  
  Utilizes GPS location, soil type, rainfall, and temperature data to recommend the most compatible pepper variety for a specific area, maximizing yield and disease resistance.

- **Image and Data-Driven Fertilizer Recommendation System**  
  Detects nutrient deficiencies through leaf image analysis and provides precise fertilizer recommendations to correct imbalances and enhance plant health.

By integrating these tools into a unified platform, **PepperPal** aims to empower pepper farmers in Sri Lanka with intelligent decision support, boosting productivity, sustainability, and income.
